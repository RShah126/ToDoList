# ToDoList

## Tools
A project made using Java servlets, and Javascript, SQL, as well as HTML and CSS
This project lets you create tasks on a webpage, cross them out, and store them in a MySQL database, all while communicating with Java.
This project also uses Apache Tomcat.

## Inspiration
I wanted to expand my knowledge in Java more, so I decided to use my web-knowledge to integrate it with Java, so that I can touch upon a old piece of technology called a servlet. This project really enhanced my knowledge of servlets, and I learned how to cross-communicate with Java. The servlets provided advanced knowledge for my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to integrate well.

## Idea
I wanted to do a simple idea, because I didn't know much, so I did something that was within my limits and timeframe. I didn't want to create something too big, as I think I needed to know more to do so, and I also didn't have as much time to create a gigantic project.
